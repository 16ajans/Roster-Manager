            b Players

        p
            b Managers

        p
            | A person can be both a manager & player at the same time, just a manager, or just a player.
            | Players may self-register and join a Manager's team during the season's registration cycle OR a Manager may register some or all of the players for their team.
        p Each person managing or competing with the League must be a member of the 
            a(href="http://discord.gg/JXbmZjp") CVRE League Discord server
            | .
        h4 Player Verification
        p
            | The League is open to persons currently enrolled in a university, college, post-secondary school, or trade school (
            a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education" target="_blank") tertiary education
            | ) during regular seasons.
        p
            | Players or Managers may submit official enrollment documentation such as current class schedules, enrollment certificates, transcripts, or 
            a(href="https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/" target="_blank") National Clearinghouse
            |  documents. These documents should clearly indicate the playerâ€™s current active status and affiliation with the institution.
        p Common verification documents include photos of student IDs (including an expiration date or similar) or screenshots of a student portal (showing classes for the current term).
        h4 Player Status
        p Once a player has provided a name, school, and Discord information - "registered" - they can be in one of four states:
            ul
                li AWAITING
                    p Player is registered, but no verification document has been submitted.
                li REVIEW 
                    p Player is registered, has verification, and is pending Admin review & approval.
                li ACCEPTED 
                    p An Admin has reviewed the submitted documentation and accepted it. The Player may now participate in the regular CVRE League season!
                li REJECTED
                    p An Admin has reviewed the submitted documentation and found it does not meet League criteria to prove current and active affiliation with a qualifying institution.
                        |  Player and/or manager should work with an Admin to identify and resubmit appropriate verification.
